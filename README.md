Macro Calculator 
------------------------
As someone passionate about fitness and nutrition, I decided to create a personalized macro calculator to help track my daily intake of macronutrientsâ€”carbohydrates, protein, fat, and calories. This project allows users to input the amount of grams consumed for specific foods, providing accurate macro calculations tailored to their diet.

I utilized a dataset from Kaggle containing information on high-protein foods and designed the tool to allow users to add their own foods, making it adaptable to individual preferences and dietary needs. Currently, the calculator supports tracking for three meals: breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

Looking ahead, I plan to enhance the tool by expanding the number of meals to include snacks, adding a menu navigation option to enable users to edit or update their entries, and incorporating visually engaging graphics for a more user-friendly experience. This project reflects my enthusiasm for fitness and my ability to leverage technology to create practical, impactful solutions.
