Macro Calculator 
------------------------
I am very into fitness and working out, so I decided to create a macro calculator in order to calculate how many macros I eat each day.

The Macros I am tracking are Cabrs, Protein, Fat, and Calories.  

You are able to put in the amount of grams you have consumed of that food in order for the calculation to be more accurate. 
I used a data set found on Kaggle that has a lot of high protein foods on it, but you are also able to add your own food to the list so it can be more personalized. 

Currently you are only able to enter in Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner. 


Future improvements: 
I want to expand the amount of meals you can add  to includes snacks. 
I also am going to add a menu option so that you can go back and add foods to certain meals. 
I also want to add graphics.
